## JasperScholten-pset5 </br> Many to-do lists

This app enables the user to keep track of its to-do items, sorted in different lists. The master view shows different lists of to-do items; the detail view shows the corresponding to-do items that are part of a specific list. In both views, new entries can be added using the '+' button. Then, an alert pops up asking the user for input. 
A user can check a todo item as being done, by switching the UIswitch in the to-do items tableview. All of these actions are saved in a database. An item could be completely deleted by swiping left on it, after which the user gets the option to delete it.

In the 'doc' folder, five screenshots can be found that show different states for the app:
* screenshotAddNewList shows an alert that pops up when the user wants to add a new list.
* screenshotAddNewTodo shows an alert that pops up when the user wants to add a new Todo.
* screenshotLandscape shows the app in Landscape mode, where a few lists and to-do items are added.
* screenshotPortraitLists shows the master view in portrait mode, where a few lists are added.
* screenshotPortraitTodos shows the detail view in portrait mode, where a few to-do items are added.
